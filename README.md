This package generates php class files (objects) from Dreamweaver template files.


#Examples found under docs/examples/

##Basic: basic/example_style1.php

###Test browser output:

* Open docs/examples/basic/example_style1.php in a browser.
* Builds a webpage object based on a class file that was previously generated by createTemplates.php.
    - The member variables of this object are editable regions that should be modified as desired.
* This uses Template_style1.php and Template_style1.tpl that have been pregenerated.


###Test template creation:

````bash
cd docs/examples/basic/
php ../../../src/UNL/DWT/createTemplates.php example.test.ini
````

This will write new versions of Template_style1.php and Template_style1.tpl to docs/examples/basic/

##Scanner: scanner_example.php

Scans a rendered DWT-based page for editable regions. All editable regions become member variables of the scanner object.
